        <strong>Units and Bankroll Management</strong> are crucial concepts in
        sports betting that help bettors manage their money effectively and

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A unit represents a fixed percentage of
            a bettor&apos;s total bankroll. It standardizes the amount wagered
            on each bet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Percentage:</strong> Typically, one unit is 1-1.5% of the
            total bankroll.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Using units helps in managing risk and
            maintaining consistent betting amounts regardless of the bankroll
            size.

          Bankroll Management
        </strong>
        <div className="w-full h-2"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Bankroll management is the strategy
            used to allocate a betting budget over a series of bets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> The goal is to ensure the bettor does
            not run out of money during a losing streak and can continue betting
            in the long run.
          </li>

          Compounding Gains
        </strong>
        <div className="w-full h-2"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Concept:</strong> Compounding gains involves reinvesting the
            profits earned from previous bets into future bets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Method:</strong> By consistently betting a fixed percentage
            of the growing bankroll, bettors can potentially increase their
            earnings over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example:</strong> If a bettor starts with a $1,000 bankroll
            and wins a few bets, increasing their bankroll to $1,100, they would
            calculate their unit size based on the new total, allowing their
            bets to grow proportionally with their bankroll.
